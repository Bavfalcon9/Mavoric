## Important
Upon the release of PM-API 4.0.0, while we will provide support for PM-API 3.0.0, 
Development for this will be slower as we will be focused on maintaining the up to date api version of pmmp. </br>
**What does this mean?** We encourage everyone to use an up to date version of the server software for stability, so we'll be focusing on that more than old api versions.
