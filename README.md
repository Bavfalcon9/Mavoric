## Description
Mavoric is a plugin designed to enforce the generic functions of MC:BE. Mavoric is designed to execute and enforce 
general cheat detection powerfully without a hassle. <br />
**Note:** Mavoric is intended to be lightweight in terms of a fully functional anticheat.

## History
Early stages of Mavoric were originally developed for the [OwnagePE](shop.ownagepe.com) network, 
after multiple failed attempts at making something functional, Mavoric was then taken into private development 
for improvements and shortly after made an appearance on [Versai](versai.pro) in August 2019 where it has been 
used on a mass scale to help improve it's overall functionality.
